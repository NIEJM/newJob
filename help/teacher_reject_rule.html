    <body>
    Tutors are able to decline “Accepted” classes due to emergency scenarios only, i.e. Illness. If the tutor wishes to reschedule the class due to any other reasons, we suggest you contacting the client so that he/she can raise a Time Change request for rescheduling.
    <br>
	There is no penalties applied to decline the class more than 4 hours before it starts, however there will be a 50% penalty to decline the class within 4 hours prior to its start. Please note that the decline rate will be recorded as a part of the tutor’s profile.
